- add to the home page a way to quickly add an expense/income to a specific sheet. It should work this way:
  1. click the add expense button
  2. get redirect on a page with links for every sheet which link to a new form for adding the element to the select sheet.
  Doing it this way avoid creating a new form, and reduce the number of clicks to perform the action.
